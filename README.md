Tax Calculator 

Just a fun little project to calculate how much tax you owe in South Africa.

Use `npm run jsxpp` to run the jsx preprocessor.

Run `node ./helpers/taxExtractor.mjs` after you have set up ./config/taxConfig.js to contain all tax information for the year you want generated, you can follow the format in the file. After that run ./helpers/taxExtractor.mjs so that files for all the tax years in ./config/taxConfig.js tax year will be put in the assets folder.
